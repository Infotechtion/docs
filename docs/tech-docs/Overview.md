# Product Overview

## Executive Summary
We live in a time of exploding data and constant information flow. This has overwhelmed our ability to effectively manage our information — and will only become more challenging. As organizations struggle to transform into truly digital businesses and leverage the next wave of AI and machine learning technologies, most have an Achilles’ heel that threatens even the most well-intentioned digital transformation initiatives. That vulnerability is out-of-control information.

In a digital age, information is the core asset, creating customer value and differentiating the offerings of one business from another. Information is also critical to how public sector organizations deliver value to constituents and taxpayers. This importance to both private sector and public sector organizations was clearly demonstrated during the pandemic, when organizations suddenly realized that unless they could rapidly digitize their business processes, they could no longer operate.

The evolution of the on-premise Office platform into the cloud-based platforms is rapidly changing the way organizations think about the challenge of organizing and governing collaborative content. 

At a minimum, organizations want to manage their data in place whilst transitioning to cloud platforms. This has also created for several organizations opportunities to retire legacy content management systems and consolidate multiple applications to fewer cloud platforms.
