# STANDARDS

## Naming Standards

The naming standards and guidelines for Azure resources followed by the i-ARM are described in this section. Following recommended naming conventions makes managing resources in the Azure environment easier, increases clarity, and makes resource grouping and recognizing them simpler.

Note: In Azure, there are several types of resources that must have globally unique names. These resources are typically part of services that need to be accessible worldwide, so the names are unique across all tenants in Azure.

Below is the list of I-ARM resources which should have unique name

* Azure Key Vault
* Azure Container Registry
* Azure SQL Database Server
* Azure App Service (Web Apps & Function Apps)
* Azure Storage Account

| **Azure Component** | **Standard** |
| --- | --- |
| Application Registration | spn-<azureserviceabbr>-iarm-<purpose>-<env> |
| Resource Group Name | rg-iarm-<purpose>-<regionabbr >-<env> |
| Azure Services (Without Storage Accounts) | <azureserviceabbr>-iarm-<iarmmodule>-<regionabbr>-<env> |
| Azure Storage Account | <azureserviceabbr>iarm<iarmmodule><regionabbr><env> **(This should always be less than 24 characters)** |
| Security Groups | sg-<azureserviceabbr>-iarm-<purpose>-<env> |
| Virtual Machine | <azureserviceabbr><iarm ><purpose><regionabbr><env> **(This should always be less than 15 characters)** |
| General Names | Must include iarm to clearly identify a dedicated use of iarm. |

## Subnets

The section below details the subnets within the Azure Virtual Network for the i-ARM solution. This isolation is critical for improving security by containing network traffic and reducing unauthorized access risks, optimizing performance through effective bandwidth management, allowing for personalized application of network security group rules, and improving clarity by logically segmenting resources. For specific subnet configurations, please refer to the section below.

| **Name** | **vNet** | **Address Space** | **Route Table** | **NSG** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subnet-iarm-webapp-regionabbr-prd | vnet-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd | x.x.x.x/25 | Default | nsg-iarm-webapp-regionabbr-prd | This subnet provides a secure and scalable environment for hosting web applications. |
| subnet-iarm-funcapp-regionabbr-prd | vnet-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd | x.x.x.x /25 | Default | nsg-iarm-funcapp-regionabbr-prd | This subnet ensures that serverless functions operate within a secure and isolated environment. |
| subnet-iarm-pe-regionabbr-prd | vnet-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd | x.x.x.x /25 | Default | nsg-iarm-pe-regionabbr-prd | This subnet secures private access to Azure services, ensuring that sensitive data is exchanged without being exposed to the public internet. |
| subnet-iarm-workloads-regionabbr-prd | vnet-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd | x.x.x.x /25 | Default | nsg-iarm-workloads-regionabbr-prd | This subnet isolates and secures virtual machines, enabling controlled access to VMs. |

# Key Vault

## Vault

Azure Key Vault is a critical component for the i-ARM solution, safeguarding secrets used by services within the i-ARM framework. It provides secure storage for sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, ensuring that they are protected with strong encryption and access policies. Integrated with Entra ID / Azure Active Directory, it enforces strict access controls, allowing only authorized users and applications to retrieve sensitive information.

* Only one key vault is required. All secrets and certificates will be stored in this key vault.

**Note:** The key vault should have the IP addresses of the Power platform to be whitelisted. These IP addresses vary depending on the region where the power platform is hosted.

**Reference:** <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform>

| **Name** | kv-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Required to securely store and access secrets, certificates, API keys. Access is tightly controlled. | |
| **Resource Group** | rg-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd | |
| **Region** | UK-SOUTH | |
| **Tier** | Standard | |
| **Access Configuration (Permission Model)** | Azure role-based access control (RBAC) | |
| **Resource Access** | Not required | |
| **Network Access** | Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses\* | |
| **Private Endpoint** | **Name** | kv-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd-pe |
| **Subnet** | subnet-iarm-pe-regionabbr-prd |
| **Private DNS Zone** | privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net |
| **Diagnostics** | Diagnostics logs are sent to the central log analytics workspace of the solution | |

\* An [azure policy exemption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure) rule needs to be created in the consumer azure portal to exempt the “kv-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd” key vault from the “[Deny-PublicPaaSEndpoints](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Deny-PublicPaaSEndpoints.html)” policy to allow configuring the Key Vault firewall with “**Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**”. This is necessary for Power Automate to read secrets from the “kv-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd” Key Vault. Since Power Automate is a cloud service, it initiates requests from the public internet and does not operate within the same private network as the key vault.

\* An [azure policy exemption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure) rule needs to be created in the consumer azure portal to exempt the “saiarmarchiveregionabbrprd” storage account from the “[Deny-PublicPaaSEndpoints](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyinitiativesadvertizer/Deny-PublicPaaSEndpoints.html)” policy to allow configuring the Storage account firewall with “**Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**”. This is necessary for Power Automate to create blobs within the “saiarmarchiveregionabbrprd” storage account. Since Power Automate is a cloud service, it initiates requests from the public internet and does not operate within the same private network as the storage account.

# Virtual Machine

## On-Premises Data Gateway

The application gateway serves as an intermediary, facilitating secure connections between external SaaS offerings, such as Power Platform and Power BI, and the SQL database that is safeguarded by a firewall or positioned behind the native platform firewall of SQL azure database.

**Note:**

* If IP Whitelisting can be configured on the Azure SQL server, then there is no need for the data gateway.
* The VM requires an interactive logon, this can be done using a local account for a one-off configuration of data gateway on the VM.
* Based on the workload, additional VMs may need to be configured to function as data gateways
* SQL connection using Data Gateway works only with either **SQL Authentication** or **Windows Authentication**
* Internet should be enabled on the Data gateway VM
* Data gateway is a manual installation by downloading MSI package from Microsoft website. Detailed steps for installation can be found here - [Install an on-premises data gateway | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install)
* The Data Gateway VM should not have any Azure policy such as Auto Shutdown Schedule configured for automatic shutdown that would cause it to shut down on its own. Reference: [Deploy Virtual Machine Auto Shutdown Schedule - Deploy-Vm-autoShutdown](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyadvertizer/Deploy-Vm-autoShutdown.html)

| **VM Name** | vmiarmdgukprd |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The gateway provides connectivity between MS Purview Power automate flows, Power BI and i-ARM database. The gateway supports the registration of records eligible for disposal between MS Purview and i-ARM. |
| **Resource Group** | rg-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd |
| **Location** | <Consumer Azure region> |
| **VM Size** | General Purpose D4ds\_v4 |
| **Operating System** | Windows Server 2022 |
| **Subnet** | subnet-iarm-workloads-regionabbr-prd |
| **Public IP** | Yes (if required for external access) |
| **Installation Requirements** | On-premises Data Gateway, .NET Framework 4.7 or later |

## i-ARM Scanner Services

The virtual machine is where the i-ARM Scanner Services will be installed. The scanner service captures the file properties and other information related to the source being scanned into the i-ARM Data Store. Infotechtion recommends a minimum of 2 Virtual Machines to host the i-ARM and MPIP Scanner Agents respectively.

| **VM Name** | vmiarmscannerservice01prd, vmiarmscannerservice02prd |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The scanner service will scan the mounted & configured Network File Shares or Azure File Shares. |
| **Resource Group** | rg-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd |
| **Location** | <Consumer Azure region> |
| **VM Size** | Standard\_D8as\_v4 (8 vcpus, 32 GiB memory) |
| **Operating System** | Windows Server 2022 |
| **Subnet** | subnet-iarm-workloads-regionabbr-prd |
| **Public IP** | Yes (if required for external access) |
| **Installation Requirements** | .NET Framework 4.7 or later, .Net Core 8.0, Information Protection Scanner |

**Note:**

* IP Whitelisting needs to be configured on the Azure KeyVault.
* The VM needs to be part of the domain and will require login from a Service Account.
* The VM should be able to communicate with the File Shares to scan an i-ARM Data Store to capture the metadata information for part of the same network as the Network File Share and
* the scanner Service Account needs Read/Write access to the Network File Share (Write only in case the Immutability feature is required)
* Incase Scanner Service is configured to scan Azure File Share, then mounting of Azure File Share has to be using Shared Access Key.
* The VM needs will require a Certificate to be installed to access the Key Vault. A certificate can either be procured from your Certificate Authority or a Self-Signed generated Certificate will also work.
* Based on the workload, additional VMs may need to be configured to scan larger number of data sources
* Internet should be enabled on the i-ARM Scanner Service VM
* If the Windows Defender service is configured to scan the NFS Agent Service folder, it should be exempted to avoid performance issues.
* Additionally, we recommend stopping the NFS Agent Service, as it has been observed to consume high CPU resources. This consumption can eventually increase runtime and decrease overall performance.
* To support scans on NFS shares, services for NFS must be deployed on the scanner machine.

On your machine, navigate to the **Windows Features (Turn Windows features on or off)** settings dialog, and select the following items: **Services for NFS** > **Administrative Tools** and **Client for NFS**.

* When the scanner is installed on a Windows server machine, you must also install the Microsoft Office iFilter in order to scan .zip files for sensitive information types.
* The i-ARM Scanner Service VM should not have any Azure policy such as Auto Shutdown Schedule configured for automatic shutdown that would cause it to shut down on its own.

## Content Type

Content Types are essential for defining the structure and metadata associated with physical records. A content type allows us to standardize the data fields used for specific categories of physical records within the system.

## Term Store

The Term Store allows us to manage and maintain a consistent set of terms and metadata ensuring uniformity in categorization of physical records.

## Search configuration

Managed properties are used to optimize the search for physical records by mapping relevant metadata fields so that these fields can be easily queried and retrieved via the search functionality. The PnP Search Webpart leverages these fields to allow authorized users to view reports based on the search and filter criteria.

# Azure DevOps

## Repository

The Infotechtion Azure DevOps code repository utilizes Git for version control, enabling collaboration through branching, pull requests, and code reviews. Integrated with Azure Pipelines for CI/CD, it automates builds and deployments while enforcing role-based access controls to ensure security and accountability in the i-ARM services development process.

| **Organization** | Infotechtion |
| --- | --- |
| **Project Name** | i-ARM Infrastructure DevOps |
| **Repo Name** | iac-iarm |

**Note:**

* During CI/CD pipeline deployments, the IPs of the Microsoft-hosted agents running the deployment jobs must be whitelisted to ensure successful deployments. It is essential that the consumer tenant allows for this IP whitelisting.

All deployments in the consumer tenant for provisioning i-ARM resources will be managed exclusively through Bicep templates from Infotechtion's Azure DevOps. Additionally, Azure CLI commands will be utilized for configuring Container Registry and Container Instance activities. Deployments for the Azure Web App, Function App, and Web Job will also be managed from the same DevOps environment.

## Azure Container Registry

## Binary validation

Binary validation helps ensure that only high-quality, secure, and correctly versioned binaries are built and released to customer environments. Binaries refer to files such as executables, libraries, or other compiled files, such as .dll and .js files

To ensure the integrity and security of our delivered packages, we perform checksum (SHA-256) validation on all binary files produced. During the build process in Infotechtion DevOps, a SHA-256 checksum is generated for each binary file and documented for reference. This check sum will be included in the release notes with a listing of each binary included in the package shared with the customer IT team to allow for independent validation.

Package Properties Includes:

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| File Name | The name of the binary file. |
| File Extension | The type of the file, indicating its format (e.g., .exe, .dll, .js). |
| File Creation Date | The date and time when the binary file was created |
| SHA256 | The SHA-256 checksum generated during the build process, used for validation. |

**Validation Process for Customer IT Teams:**

Once the package is deployed, the customer IT team can validate the binaries using a script provided by Infotechtion. This script generates a SHA-256 inventory of each binary deployed via the package.

To validate the binaries from the Azure resource side, follow the following steps:

1. Download the Deployment package

* Navigate to customer managed Azure portal.
* Go to i-ARM resource Group “rg-iarm-svc-regionabbr-prd”
* Navigate to each i-ARM resources listed below and download it to the local system. (Note: In the **Landing Zone**, please note that additional steps may be required for downloading. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to the resources)
  + [Function Apps](#_Function_App)
  + [Web Apps](#_App_Service)

1. Extract the Package

* The package would be compressed (e.g., in a .zip format), extracting the contents to a designated folder on the local system.

1. Run the SHA-256 Validation Script

* Open a terminal or command prompt on the local machine.
* Navigate to the directory where the extracted binaries are located.
* Execute the SHA-256 validation script provided by Infotechtion. This script will generate SHA-256 checksums for all binary files in the directory and compare them against the checksums listed in the release notes.

1. Validation

* Ensure that all checksums match the release notes shared.

1. To be confirmed during configuration based on alignment with the consumer cloud support. [↑](#footnote-ref-2)
